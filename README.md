# Learning-Notes-for-Pattern-Recognition
Notes while learning Pattern Recognition and Python
These codes are about a specific work. While solving the work. Each fold is about a work and some notes about the functions used in dealing with it. As it is the first time for me to upload the codes and the notes, I hope these can be useful for those who are also fresh in deep learning and pattern recogniton.
