As showed in many reference books, esch model we build can be overfitted. 
This work will show that what is overfitting and how can the model be overfitted. 
Imaging that we want to fit a linear model as 'y = a*x+b+c', where a = 3 and b = 6, x and c follows some certain normal distributions. 
As the sample number varies, the result of the model varies, too. 
We will use different model and different sample numbers to built our model and compare them with each other.
